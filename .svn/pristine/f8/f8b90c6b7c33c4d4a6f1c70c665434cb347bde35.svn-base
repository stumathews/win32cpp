BOOL is a typedef for an integer value that is used in a Boolean context. 
The header file WinDef.h also defines two values for use with BOOL, TRUE and FALSE

These datatypes are always the size of a pointer on the platform its running on (32 for 32bit platforms, 64 for 64)

Quick recap on strings:

typedef wchar_t WCHAR;
wchar_t a = L'a';
wchar_t *str = L"hello";

CHAR				= char
PSTR or LPSTR		= char*
PCSTR or LPCSTR		= const char*
PWSTR or LPWSTR		= wchar_t*
PCWSTR or LPCWSTR	= const wchar_t*

String macros:

TCHAR		= wchar_t(on UNICODE system) 	
TCHAR		= char(on ANSI system)
TEXT("x")	= L"x"(on UNICODE system)
TEXT("x")	= "x"
